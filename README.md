# Note Taker

## Description

This project was designed for anyone who want to take notes, save them, and delete them. The application uses a back end powered by Express.js, which also creates the functionality of the app including saving and deleting the notes. I've learned a lot about Express.js while working on this project, and I've really learned a lot. I'm ready to continue learning more about the back-end side of web applications now!

Note: This is unfinished, as I'm having trouble with utilizing the delete button.

## Installation

The steps it takes to install this application are as follows:

Open your CLI and clone the repository onto your local machine using the `git clone` command. Next, in your favorite code editor, open up the files you just cloned.
Open your CLI once again, this time in your code editor, and then type `npm i` and click `enter` on your keyboard. This is going to install the node module packets needed for it to function.

## Usage

To use this project, navigate to the cloned files after installing them, and then type `node server.js` in your command line. After this, a message will pop up in the console, where you can copy and paste `localhost:3001` into your browser, to view and try out the fully functional application.

## Credits and Contribution

In this project, I used the starter code found in Xandromus's "miniature-eureka" repository to start with a front-end for this web application.
