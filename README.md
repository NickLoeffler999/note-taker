# Note Taker

## Description

## Installation

The steps it takes to install this application are as follows:

Open your CLI and clone the repository onto your local machine using the `git clone` command. Next, in your favorite code editor, open up the files you just cloned.

## Usage

To use this project, navigate to the cloned files after installing them, and then type `node server.js` in your command line. After this, a message will pop up in the console, where you can copy and paste `localhost:3001` into your browser, to view and try out the fully functional application.

## Credits and Contribution

In this project, I used the starter code found in Xandromus's "miniature-eureka" repository to start with a front-end for this web application.
